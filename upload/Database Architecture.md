• Bookmarks

• Calculator History

• Offline Cache

• Settings

Never permanently store

• KTU Passwords

# IMPLEMENTATION SCOPE

Separate

Architecture

from

Implementation.

If a feature is marked Future,

Design

• Interfaces

• Providers

• Types

• Folder Structure

• Components

• Services

But DO NOT integrate SDKs.

Examples

✓ Create AdsProvider

✗ Do not install AdMob

✓ Create PaymentProvider

✗ Do not integrate Razorpay

✓ Create StudentService

✗ Do not implement KTU login

✓ Create StorageProvider

✗ Do not configure Cloudflare R2

Architecture first.

Implementation later.
