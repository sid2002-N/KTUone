# PROJECT OVERVIEW

Project Name

KTU One

Mission

Build the ultimate companion app for APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University students.

The application should work as

• Responsive Web Application

• Progressive Web App (PWA)

• Capacitor Android App

The web application is the primary platform.

Capacitor will later wrap the application into an APK.

Never make architectural decisions that would prevent Capacitor compatibility.

# ARCHITECTURE GOALS

The application should be

Production Ready

Highly Scalable

Highly Maintainable

Feature First

Offline Friendly

Fast

Secure

Modular

Reusable

Future Proof

Easy for AI agents to extend

# SOFTWARE PRINCIPLES

Follow

SOLID

DRY

KISS

YAGNI

Composition over Inheritance

Dependency Injection where appropriate

Single Responsibility

Open Closed Principle

Feature Encapsulation

Server First

---

# APPLICATION STRUCTURE

Use Feature First Architecture.

Structure should resemble

app/

components/

features/

hooks/

services/

actions/

lib/

store/

types/

constants/

config/

utils/

styles/

public/

prisma/

middleware.ts

Each folder should be explained.

Explain why it exists.

---
# THIRD-PARTY PROVIDER ARCHITECTURE

Every external dependency must be abstracted behind a Provider or Service interface.

The UI and business logic must NEVER directly depend on a third-party SDK.

Examples

AdsProvider

PaymentProvider

StudentService

StorageProvider

NotificationProvider

AnalyticsProvider

Implementations can be swapped without changing UI components.

Example

BannerAd

↓

AdsProvider

↓

AdsenseProvider (Web)

↓

AdMobProvider (Android)

The page component should never know which provider is being used.

# FEATURE STRUCTURE

Every feature should have

components/

hooks/

types/

schemas/

actions/

services/

constants/

utils/

Example

features/

attendance/

components/

hooks/

schemas/

types/

services/

actions/

utils/

Never allow features to directly depend on each other.

Communication should happen through shared services.

# IMPLEMENTATION SCOPE

Separate

Architecture

from

Implementation.

If a feature is marked Future,

Design

• Interfaces

• Providers

• Types

• Folder Structure

• Components

• Services

But DO NOT integrate SDKs.

Examples

✓ Create AdsProvider

✗ Do not install AdMob

✓ Create PaymentProvider

✗ Do not integrate Razorpay

✓ Create StudentService

✗ Do not implement KTU login

✓ Create StorageProvider

✗ Do not configure Cloudflare R2

Architecture first.

Implementation later.
